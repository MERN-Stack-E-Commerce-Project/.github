## Hi there üëã

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**
-->
üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This Organization contained three project repositories based on an E-Commerce website\
      - One for User-side interface\
      - 2nd for Admin-side interface\
      - another one for the Server-side queries\
   this app utilizes keen knowledge of web development and i had implemented NodeJS, MongoDB, ReactJS, Redux, JWT mainly.

#### About Project
üåàThe project is ongoing under Prof. Pawan kumar at IIT Kharagpur as Bachelor's Project, 
Research fields are Data analysis and Mathematical modeling.
The goal of the project is to develop algorithms, statical models, and optimization techniques to improve various aspects of E-commerce platforms such as recommendation systems, pricing strategies, supply chain management and customer behavior analysis.

Recommendation Systems:
Recommendation systems are algorithms and techniques used to suggest relevant items or content to users. They are widely used in various online platforms, such as e-commerce websites, streaming services, and social media platforms. The goal of recommendation systems is to provide personalized and tailored suggestions to users based on their past behavior, preferences, and interactions with the platform. These systems use data analysis and machine learning methods to predict user interests and make recommendations that increase user engagement and satisfaction.
For example, in an e-commerce recommendation system, if a user has shown interest in a particular category of products or purchased specific items, the system can suggest similar or complementary products to encourage further exploration and potential purchases.

#### brief description 
Pricing Strategies:
Pricing strategies refer to the methods and approaches that businesses use to set the prices of their products or services. Pricing decisions have a significant impact on a company's profitability, market position, and customer perception. Various pricing strategies can be employed, such as cost-based pricing, value-based pricing, competitive pricing, dynamic pricing, and penetration pricing.
For instance, cost-based pricing involves setting prices based on production costs and adding a markup for profit, while value-based pricing focuses on pricing products based on the perceived value to the customer. Dynamic pricing, on the other hand, involves adjusting prices in real time based on factors like demand, seasonality, or competitor pricing.

Supply Chain Management:
Supply chain management involves the coordination and optimization of activities involved in the production, distribution, and delivery of goods and services from suppliers to consumers. It aims to ensure the smooth flow of materials, information, and finances throughout the supply chain to minimize costs, reduce inefficiencies, and improve customer satisfaction.
Effective supply chain management involves various components, including procurement, inventory management, logistics, transportation, warehousing, and demand forecasting. Advanced technologies, such as data analytics and blockchain, are increasingly used to enhance supply chain visibility and responsiveness.

Customer Behavior Analysis:
Customer behavior analysis involves studying and understanding the actions, preferences, and decision-making patterns of customers. This analysis is crucial for businesses to tailor their products, marketing strategies, and customer experiences to meet customer needs effectively.
 
#### Implemented User Interface at Admin-side
Admin can :\
Register and Login for particular interval of time till JWT Token is valid then will logout Automaticallyy after expiry\
Admin can design separate store like: Apple, MI etc.
Admin can alter the Categories information and relevant product of categories\
Admin can access the newly ordered product from user side\
#### Implementation at Backend
The framework used: NodeJS,\
The database used : MongoDB\
Models/Scema used for various dataset:\
1) User - To store login credential as well as user information
2) Category- to list various category for user in app
3) Product - to list varoius product in category
4) cart - to save information of user for added items in cart
5) Address -  To deliver item in particular address of user after confirmation of order
6) Page - To display separate page of a particular brand like : Apple, MI etc
7) Order - To Store ordered items by user for further process

Authentication: bcrypt library used to encrypt user password.
